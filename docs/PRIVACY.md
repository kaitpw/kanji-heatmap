# Privacy Policy

_Last Updated: March 24, 2025_

[PikaPikaGems](https://github.com/PikaPikaGems) operates kanjiheatmap.com (the “Site”). This Privacy Policy explains how we handle information related to your use of the Site.

## Information We Collect

We do not collect personal information such as names, email addresses, or any other identifiable data directly from you. We also do not use cookies or similar tracking technologies.

## Third-Party Services: Cloudflare

We use Cloudflare’s analytics tools to understand how the Site performs and how visitors interact with it. These tools include:

- **HTTP Traffic and Web Analytics**: Cloudflare collects and provides us with aggregated, anonymized data about Site usage, such as page views and general traffic patterns. This does not include personal information about individual visitors.

- **Real User Measurements (RUM)**: Cloudflare injects a small JavaScript snippet into the Site to measure performance and user experience (e.g. page load times). This may collect limited technical data, such as browser type, device information, or IP addresses, but we only receive this data in an aggregated and anonymized form.

Cloudflare processes this data on our behalf. For more details on how Cloudflare handles information, please refer to [Cloudflare’s Privacy Policy](https://www.cloudflare.com/privacypolicy/).

## How We Use Information

The anonymized data from Cloudflare helps us monitor the Site’s performance and improve its functionality. We do not use this data to identify or track individual visitors.

## Sharing of Information

We do not sell, trade, or share any personal information with third parties because we don’t collect it. The aggregated analytics data from Cloudflare is used solely by us for the purposes described above.

## Your Choices

Since we don’t collect personal information or use cookies, there are no specific privacy settings for you to manage on the Site. If you have concerns about Cloudflare’s analytics, you can review their practices directly or use browser tools (like Do Not Track settings) to limit data collection, though this may not fully apply to aggregated analytics.

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we do, the updated version will be posted here with a revised “Last Updated” date.
