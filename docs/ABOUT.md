# About

Kanji Heatmap is an exploration tool with advanced filtering, sorting, frequency
heatmap visualizations, and detailed kanji information.

This tool can help you prioritize which kanji to learn based on your specific
goals. The kanji you encounter in casual Twitter posts differ from those found
in literary works, and the kanji commonly used in TV dramas may vary from those
in news articles.

Visual learners will appreciate the heatmap feature, which highlights more
frequently used kanji in brighter colors, with less common characters shown in
progressively duller shades.

Unlike many kanji resources that display characters in a single style, Kanji
Heatmap lets you change fonts to see how the appearance of characters can vary.

While Kanji Heatmap is not a dictionary, it offers useful kanji details. Simply
click on any kanji to view sample words, meanings, onyomi and kunyomi readings,
stroke order animations, component breakdowns, and more.
