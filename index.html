            Kanji Heatmap is an exploration tool with advanced filtering,
            sorting, frequency heatmap visualizations, and detailed kanji
            information. This tool can help you prioritize which kanji to learn
            based on your specific goals.
          </p>
          <p>
            The kanji you encounter in casual Twitter posts differ from those
            found in literary works, and the kanji commonly used in TV dramas
            may vary from those in news articles.
          </p>
          <p>
            Visual learners will appreciate the heatmap feature, which
            highlights more frequently used kanji in brighter colors, with less
            common characters shown in progressively duller shades.{" "}
          </p>
          <p>
            Unlike many kanji resources that display characters in a single
            style, Kanji Heatmap lets you change fonts to see how the appearance
            of characters can vary.
          </p>
          <p>
            While Kanji Heatmap is not a dictionary, it offers useful kanji
            details. Simply click on any kanji to view sample words, meanings,
            onyomi and kunyomi readings, stroke order animations, component
            breakdowns, and more.

          Japanese language learners in visualizing and prioritizing kanji
          characters based on their frequency of use. Here's a detailed
          breakdown: Core Features: Heatmap Visualization: Kanji are displayed
          in a grid, color-coded to indicate usage frequency (e.g., warm colors
          like red for high frequency, cooler colors like blue for rare
          characters). A legend clarifies the frequency-intensity scale, helping
          users quickly identify which kanji to prioritize. Interactive Kanji
          Cards: Clicking a character reveals detailed information, including
          readings (onyomi/kunyomi), meanings, stroke order, and example
          compounds. Links to external resources (e.g., Jisho, WaniKani) are
          provided for deeper study. Filtering and Search: Users can filter
          kanji by JLPT levels (N5-N1) or Japanese school grades (1st-6th),
          aligning with standardized learning benchmarks. A search bar allows
          quick lookup by kanji, reading, or English meaning. Mobile-Friendly
          Design: Responsive layout ensures accessibility across devices, from
          desktops to smartphones. Target Audience: Learners: Focus on
          high-frequency kanji to optimize study time for exams (JLPT) or

          around commonly encountered characters. Data Sources & Utility: Likely
          aggregates frequency data from contemporary Japanese media (news,
          literature, online content), though the exact source isn’t specified.
          Serves as a quick reference tool rather than a comprehensive learning
          platform, complementing apps like Anki or textbooks. Potential

          practice or memorization features. Overall Impression:
          KanjiHeatmap.com is a streamlined, visually intuitive resource for
          learners to efficiently identify and study the most relevant kanji.
          Its strength lies in simplifying prioritization through data-driven
