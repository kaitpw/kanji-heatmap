# About

Kanji Heatmap is an exploration tool with advanced filtering, sorting, frequency heatmap
visualizations, and detailed kanji information.

This tool can help you prioritize which kanji to learn based on your specific goals.
The kanji you encounter in casual Twitter posts differ from those found in literary works,
and the kanji commonly used in TV dramas may vary from those in news articles.

Visual learners will appreciate the heatmap feature, which highlights more frequently
used kanji in brighter colors, with less common characters shown in progressively duller shades.

Unlike many kanji resources that display characters in a single style, Kanji Heatmap lets you
change fonts to see how the appearance of characters can vary.

While Kanji Heatmap is not a dictionary, it offers useful kanji details. Simply click on any
kanji to view sample words, meanings, onyomi and kunyomi readings, stroke order animations,
component breakdowns, and more.
