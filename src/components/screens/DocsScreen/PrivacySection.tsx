          <strong>HTTP Traffic and Web Analytics</strong>: Cloudflare collects
          and provides us with aggregated, anonymized data about Site usage,
          such as page views and general traffic patterns. This does not include
          personal information about individual visitors.

        <li>
          <strong>Real User Measurements (RUM)</strong>: Cloudflare injects a
          small JavaScript snippet into the Site to measure performance and user
          experience (e.g. page load times). This may collect limited technical
          data, such as browser type, device information, or IP addresses, but
          we only receive this data in an aggregated and anonymized form.

        How We Use Information
      </h2>

      <p className="leading-7 mb-4">
        The anonymized data from Cloudflare helps us monitor the {`Site's `}
        performance and improve its functionality. We do not use this data to
        identify or track individual visitors.

        Sharing of Information
      </h2>

      <p className="leading-7 mb-4">
        We do not sell, trade, or share any personal information with third
        parties because we {"don't"}{" "}
        collect it. The aggregated analytics data from Cloudflare is used solely
        by us for the purposes described above.

        Your Choices
      </h2>

      <p className="leading-7 mb-4">
        Since we {"don't"}{" "}
        collect personal information or use cookies, there are no specific
        privacy settings for you to manage on the Site. If you have concerns
        about {"Cloudflare's"}{" "}
        analytics, you can review their practices directly or use browser tools
        (like Do Not Track settings) to limit data collection, though this may
        not fully apply to aggregated analytics.
